This project implements a Hotel Order Service, consisting of two microservices built with Spring Boot. The architecture includes an API Gateway to simplify access to the microservices through a single port. The security of the endpoints is enforced using JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. Additionally, global exception handling is implemented through a GlobalExceptionHandler to provide customized error messages.
